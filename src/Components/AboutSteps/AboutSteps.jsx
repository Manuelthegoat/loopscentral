          LOOPSCENTRAL is a marketplace for licensing sample packs and their
          underlying musical composition, samples and loops for use in all
          matters relating to music production. You can use the Platform either
          as someone who creates Samples and wants to license them to other
          people, or as someone who wants to license Samples for incorporation
          in their own music production. Loopscentral is on a mission to help
          producers and sound designers explore a wide variety of musical
          compositions and empower their creativity while earning a living via
          their production experience. Here's why we do what we do and how we
          get it done. Creators we are aiming at empowering include producers,
          instrumentalists, beat makers, sound designers, vocalists and
          musicians. What binds the creators we serve together is that they make
          a living doing work that matters, and they earn that living online via
          our platform. Our best days are the ones when we create. Every person
          on the team is a creator and can roll up their sleeves to help build a
          better product and company. We believe consistent progress every day
          leads to incredible results.
